Introduction to non-static pages and using data structures in JavaScript

While looking into front end development material, I realized quick that the most important factor while building these webapps is to prioritize how the user interacts with the product. I wanted my next project to be an app that allowed the user to interact with the page and that provided feedback to the user. This led em to create a mini quiz that used data structures in JavaScript and provided a score feedback at the end. This project allowed me to explore non-static pages.
